Over the summer, I took a three week vacation in Europe where I toured around Germany, England, and Austria. This was the first time I have ever left the country... Well, actually it is the first vacation I ever took in my life besides when I went to Florida 15 years ago. These three weeks were the best time I had in my entire life. I am going to share images and stories of some of my best experiences over there.
