```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

This next chunk of code will show the basics of creating a Simple Bar
graph in Rstudio to show data in a different possible way.
```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight 
FROM Master"
#Good example of storing all the data into a variable that you
#Can use elsewhere in your code
result<-sqldf(query)
#Issue with all clors default making it this bright pink
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="white",bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Body-Weight of the fat baseball players")

```
