<p>This next code is an example of a scatterplot we learned in class. It gathers all the data and plots thm as dots on a graph to make it easier to visualize the data. We also draw lines between each of the data points to make it easier to visualize how the points are ordered.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
#This is a scatterplot that has two columns of numerical data and one 
#represents time wile the other reperesents different points of data
query&lt;-&quot;SELECT yearID,HR
FROM Batting 
WHERE playerID=&#39;ruthba01&#39;&quot;

result&lt;-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Home Runs Per Year for Babe Ruth&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Home Runs&quot;)</code></pre>
